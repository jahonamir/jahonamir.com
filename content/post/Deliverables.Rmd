## ES&T Publication (In Review): Statewide Bioenergy Lifecycle Emissions Analysis

Here I worked with Berkeley Lab's Sustainable Energy Systems group to evaluate the lifecycle greenhouse gas impact of bioenergy byproducts California wide. 

##### M. Breunig, Hanna & Amirebrahimi, Jahon & Smith, Sarah & D. Scown, Corinne (2019). Bioenergy byproduct-to-land life-cycle for the gasification and anaerobic digestion of Californiaâ€™s biomass residues.

This code snippet in R uses tidyverse to aggregate emission impacts evaluated.  
```{Bioenergy Byproduct GHG Summation}
emissions.summary.co2eq <- byproduct.emissions %>%
    group_by(year, biomass.category, product) %>%
    summarize(ch4.emitted.compost.digestate.co2eq = sum(ch4.digestate.compost.tonne.co2eq, na.rm= T),
              co2.emitted.compost.digestate.co2eq = sum(co2.digestate.compost.tonne.co2eq, na.rm= T),
              ch4.emitted.digestate.decay.co2eq = sum(ch4.emit.digestate.soil.tonne.co2eq, na.rm = T),
              n2o.emitted.digestate.decay.co2eq = sum(n2o.digestate.tonne.co2eq, na.rm = T),
              co2.emitted.biochar.digestate.decay.co2eq = sum(co2.emit.soil.tonne.co2eq, na.rm = T),
              carbon.accumulation.biochar.digestate.co2eq = sum(soil.C.accumulated.tonne.co2, na.rm = T),
              carbon.sink.npp.digestate.co2eq = sum(npp.change.tonne.co2eq, na.rm= T),
              n2o.sink.biochar.soil.co2eq = sum(n2o.sink.biochar.soil.tonne.co2eq, na.rm = T),
              ch4.sink.biochar.soil.co2eq = sum(ch4.sink.biochar.soil.tonne.co2eq, na.rm = T),     
              ghg.trucking.tillage.co2eq = sum(trucking.co2eq, na.rm = T),
              scenario = scenarios$scenario[index])
  
  emissions.summary.co2eq <- melt(emissions.summary.co2eq, 
                            id.vars = c('year','biomass.category','product', 'scenario'), 
                            variable.name = 'process', 
                            value.name = 'value')
```

## Task Report: Facility Lifecycle Emissions Analysis

Here I worked with Berkeley Lab's Electricity Markets & Policy group to evaluate the lifecycle greenhouse gas impact of a Californian Bioenergy Facility for the California Energy Commission.

This code snippet in R uses matrix algebra to aggregate emission factors with facility processes.  
```{lca}
y$scenario <- cases[scenario]
y$contributors <- rownames(y)
y.inputs <- rbind(y.inputs, y)
normalization.factor <- sum(tonnage.by.location.daily$value, na.rm = T)
y[,"y"] <- y[,"y"] / normalization.factor
y1 <- y
y1[y1>0] <- 0
y1 <- abs(y1)
y[y<0] <- 0
results.kg.co2eq <- TotalGHGEmissions(A, data.matrix(y, rownames.force = NA),
                                      co2.filepath,
                                      ch4.filepath, n2o.filepath,
                                      time.horizon)
```

## Masters Thesis: Project Financial Model

I developed a financial model to determine the feasibility of anaerobic digestion facilities varying state market context and end product. 

##### Amirebrahimi, Jahon (2019). Determining Dry Anaerobic Digestion Feasibility to Advance State Environmental Ambitions. Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley. 

This code snippet in R calculates the net present value and internal rate of return using facility cost and revenue vectors.
```{Thesis Code}
opData <- CalculateOpsData(wasteData, 'base')
unitCost <- read.csv(file.path(model_path, 'inputs', 'unit_costs_USA.csv'))
costList <- list(); n <- 1; m <- 1
for (scale_scenario in names(scenarioScalars)){
  costList[[m]] <- CalculateCostData(opData, unitCost)
  m <- m + 1
}
costDataFrame <- do.call("rbind", costList)
profit.npv.irr <- CalculateStateNPVandIRR(costDataFrame)
results.df <- data.frame(
  digester.mass = profit.npv.irr[['npv']][['digester.mass']],
  average.cash = profit.npv.irr[['average']][['value']],
  npv = profit.npv.irr[['npv']][['value']],
  irr = profit.npv.irr[['irr']][['value']],
  state = profit.npv.irr[['npv']][['state']],
  scenario2 = profit.npv.irr[['npv']][['scenario2']]
)
```

## Course Project: The Effect of Raising the Minimum Wage on Teen Employment

Although off the beaten path topically, I thought I'd show you some mapping and regression work I did for Rucker Johnson's Regression Analysis course I took at Goldman. I used data generated by the US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to examine how minimum wage increases impact teen employment.  
  
For the map highlighting selected states:  
```{map example}
ggplot(data = usa) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = 'black') + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  geom_polygon(data = usa.subset, 
               aes(x = long, 
                   y = lat, 
                   fill = meandif, 
                   group = group), color = 'black') +
  theme(legend.position = 'top') +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'grey', high = 'blue') +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL)) +
  ditch_the_axes +
  ggtitle(label = "Average Difference Between State and Federal Minimum Wage", 
          subtitle = "In Real Wages of Selected States Between 1990 and 2013") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
Which resulted in:

</center> 
**
And the code which generates the results (after the linear models are defined) using the stargazer package in R:  
```{stargazer}
stargazer(Model.1, Model.2, Model.8, Model.9, Model.10, Model.11, type = 'text', 
          title='Regression Results', align=TRUE, 
          dep.var.labels=c('Employed Ages 16-19', 'Employed Ages 16-17', 'Employed White Ages 16-19'),
          covariate.labels=c('Treatment States','Post 2004','Treatment X Post 2004', 'Log Real State Minimum Wage'))
```
  
And the resulting figure:

## Client Project: Storage Policy Evaluation

While at Goldman, my team worked with the consultancy Strategen and their advocacy wing - the California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) - to evaluate Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) impact on the storage market.

Here's a slide from our deck summarizing the depth of planning CCAs have to adopt storage.

## Course Project: Wholesale Electricity Auctions  

For Severin Bornstein's Energy Markets course, we acted as independent competitive electricty generators and developed an industry wide model that evaluated bidding behavior, market and regulatory shifts to maximize firm profits.  
  
Here's a graph generating industry marginal cost given these shifts relative to generator capacity and our firm's position.

## Course Project: Bioenergy Generation Least Cost Path

For Ian Wang's Spatial Ecology course I use Hanna Bruenig's biomass inventory to determine the least cost path for bioenergy production. 
  
Here's a plot of the potential wet anaerobic digestion facility locations in California.  
**

**
After reading and stacking spatial data using the special features and raster packages in R, I develop a raster layer with biomass locations and bioenergy facility locations and generate least cost paths between the two per county.
```{LCP}
wet_or_dry <- c('wetAD', 'dryAD')
biomass_stack_sp <- as(biomass_stack, 'Spatial')
facility_stack_sp <- as(facility_stack, 'Spatial')
county_sp <- as(county, 'Spatial')
dry_paths <- list()
wet_paths <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(county_sp)) {
  cty_sp <- county_sp[county_sp$COUNTY == county_sp$COUNTY[i],]
  for(j in 1:length(wet.or.dry)) {
  biomass_pts <- biomass_stack_sp[biomass_stack_sp$COUNTY == county_sp$COUNTY[i] &
                                    biomass_stack_sp$process == wet_or_dry[j],]
  facility_pts <- facility_stack_sp[facility_stack_sp$COUNTY == county_sp$COUNTY[i] &
                                      facility_stack_sp$process == wet_or_dry[j],]
  if(nrow(facility_pts) > 0) {
    if(nrow(biomass_pts) > 0) {
      biomass_pts <- crop(biomass_pts, cty_sp)
      facility_pts <- crop(facility_pts, cty_sp)
      if(is.null(facility_pts) == F) {
        if (is.null(biomass_pts) == F) {
          cty_r <- raster()
          extent(cty_r) <- extent(cty_sp)
          ncol(cty_r) <- 10
          nrow(cty_r) <- 10
          cty_r <- rasterize(coordinates(biomass_pts), cty_r, values = biomass_pts$value, background = 0, fun = sum)
          cond_mat <- matrix(c(
            0, 0.1, 0.001,
            0.11, max(getValues(cty_r)), 1), 
            ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
          
          cond_surface <- reclassify(cty_r, cond_mat, include.lowest = TRUE, right = FALSE)
          res_surface <- 1/cond_surface
          tr_surface <- transition(res_surface, transitionFunction = mean, directions = 8)
          tr_surface <- geoCorrection(tr_surface, type="c", scl = FALSE)
          paths <- shortestPath(x = tr_surface, 
                                origin = biomass_pts, 
                                goal = facility_pts, 
                                output="SpatialLines")
          if (wet_or_dry[j] == 'wetAD') {
            wet_paths[[i]] <- paths
            plot(cty_sp, main = paste(county_sp$COUNTY[i], wet_or_dry[j]), col = 'grey85') 
            plot(biomass_pts, col = 'green', add = T)
            plot(facility_pts, col = 'red', add = T)
            lines(paths, col = 'yellow',lwd=2)
            Sys.sleep(0.5)
          } else {
            dry_paths[[i]] <- paths
            plot(cty_sp, main = paste(county_sp$COUNTY[i], wet_or_dry[j]), col = 'grey85') 
            plot(biomass_pts, col = 'green', add = T)
            plot(facility_pts, col = 'red', add = T)
            lines(paths, col = 'yellow', lwd=2)
            Sys.sleep(0.5)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  }
}
```
The loop generates plots for all counties in California, but here is one generated for Yuba.
