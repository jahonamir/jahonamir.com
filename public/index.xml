      <description>Hi there!My name is Jahon. Pronounced Jahân or d͡ʒæhɒŋ, referring to the world, universe, or galaxy in Persian, Urdu, Dari and Sanskrit.
A ClueAlthough I was given this grandiose name, I never fully knew it’s meaning until much later in life. Growing up a lower-middle working class suburb just east of the city center of Sacramento, California, the common language was American English and that side of my family practiced the predominant culture.</description>
